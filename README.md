Use this tool to exclude unwanted NFT combinations. Watch the tutorial on how to use this tool here: 

This tool reuires that you already have the metadata and image files generated. If you need to generate image/metadata files follow the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP52b__YU_s&t

To use this tool:
1. Clone the repo and open in the IDE of your choice. 
2. Add your numbered NFT collection of images and metadata into the "Inputs" folder
3. Modify the exclusions list in main.py to designate attribute combinations or specific NFTs you would like to remove.
4. Type `python3 main.py` or `py main.py` in the terminal to run

Voila, final NFT collection ends up in the Outputs folder.
